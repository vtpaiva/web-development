## Requirements
### Users
* Clients
  * Able to purchase airline tickets and hotel accommodations in the destination city.
* Administrators
  * Able to manage other administrators, clients, and offers.

### Product/Service Purchases
* Clients can add flights and accommodations to a shopping cart. After that, they should be able to complete the purchase using a credit card.

### Product/Service Management
* Administrators should be able to perform CRUD operations on all offers available on the website.

### Usability
* The system should be easy to use and highly accessible.
* The system must be responsive, ensuring timely operations.

## Project Description
### Features
* Account management.
* Airline ticket purchasing.
* Hotel accommodation purchasing.
* Reservation tracking.

#### Additional Feature
* Based on the flight destination cities, the system should offer accommodations in hotels in the same location. This way, the customer can easily integrate both purchases without needing to go to competitors, increasing our competitiveness in the market.

### Navigation
* The screen prototypes on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pUHEav14fR9GSXJ9Gk1iWq/Web-Milestone1?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Lli3eqv7sJLlKVP3-1), as well as the navigation shown in the video below, illustrate the interaction between screens to meet the requirements proposed above.
